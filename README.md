# Smart Brain App

This has a user register/login then has them input a url for an image. If the image has a face in it, it will draw a red box aroud the face.

I made both the front end and the back end for this app using javascript, react and node.js.This was my first full stack app.

The app uses an sql database to keep track of users as well as how many times they have used the app to identify a face with the app.

The image is processed using a third-party api. After sending the url to the api, my app recieve the coordinates for the bounding box.
